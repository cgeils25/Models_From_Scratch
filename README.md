Hello! This repo will be a collection of exercises in which I'll implement different classical machine learning algorithms from scratch, and then apply these models to both toy and real-world datasets.

To be clear, by "from scratch", I mean that I'm only allowed to use basic addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, and exponents and logarithms. All gradients, loss calculations, and ML algorithms will be hand-written by me. 

My motivation for doing this is both to deepen my understanding of relevant theory as well as strengthening my python data science skillset.

All models will have their own directories, named accordingly, along with a readme explaining the project and what I learned.

Currently, I've completed Logistic Regression, and I plan to build a support vector machine next.
