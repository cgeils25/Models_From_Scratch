Hello! This repo will be a collection of exercises in which I'll implement different classical machine learning algorithms from scratch, and then apply these models to both toy and real-world datasets.

My motivation for doing this is both to deepen my understanding of relevant theory as well as strengthening my python data science skillset.

Currently, I've completed Logistic Regression, and I plan to try and implement a support vector machine next.
